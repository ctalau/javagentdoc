# Annotation_type: `Subscribe`

**Package:** [`com.google.common.eventbus`](README.md)

**Fully Qualified Name:** `com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe`

**Implements:** `java.lang.annotation.Annotation`

## Description

Marks a method as an event subscriber.

 <p>The type of event will be indicated by the method's first (and only) parameter, which cannot
 be primitive. If this annotation is applied to methods with zero parameters, or more than one
 parameter, the object containing the method will not be able to register for event delivery from
 the {@link EventBus}.

 <p>Unless also annotated with @{@link AllowConcurrentEvents}, event subscriber methods will be
 invoked serially by each event bus that they are registered with.
